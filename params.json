{"name":"Eric Hall's Bio","tagline":"A quick bit about me","body":"My name is Eric Hall and I recently joined GitHub to lead global sales as Chief Revenue Officer.  I am honored to join such an exciting company that provides the leading collaborative platform for software development and web-based source code hosting. \r\n\r\nPrior to GitHub, I was an executive at ServiceSource, the global leader of recurring revenue management solutions.  I played a number of leadership roles at SREV; as SVP & GM of Operations Services & Data Services; and SVP & GM for Global Enterprise Accounts.  At SREV I had the privilege to lead an awesome global team of sales and operations professionals serving some of the best technology companies in the world.  We helped our clients to optimize recurring revenue (subscription, maintenance, support), retain more customers, grow customer relationships, increase renewal rates, and optimize policies and business practices.\r\n\r\nPrior to ServiceSource, I was a consultant at McKinsey & Company where I served a broad set of companies in areas of strategy, sales & marketing, operations, and business transformation.  At McKinsey I was able to develop my skills and experience in strategy and execution - and the critical balance of both that is required for success.\r\n\r\nMy professional interests are focused on …. leadership…. sales excellence… business growth… and highly-productive teams  \r\n\r\nWhen not discussing the magic of GitHub with current and future customers, I spend my time outdoors and with my family.  I am a slowish triathlete (Olympic distance focus) and enjoy stand-up paddle boarding, often with kids or giant newfoundland on board. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
